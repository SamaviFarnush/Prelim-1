# Prelim-1
Q1
Answer can be found in the ChemE 7770_Samavi_Prelim_1.pdf (pg 2-3)

Q2
Instuction for running the code
	Download "Q2.m" "model.m" "getparam.m" from Q2\~ in the same directory
	Run Q2.m from MATLAB
	-It will generate graphs for steady state protein production without inducer and also for Phase 1 and Phase 2 as 	described in the question.
Additional
	Explanation and assumptions for the code is given in ChemE 7770_Samavi_Prelim_1.pdf (pg 4-5)
