Q1
Answer can be found in the ChemE 7770_Samavi_Prelim_1.pdf (pg 2-3)

Q2
Instuction for running the code
	Download "Q2.m" "model.m" "getparam.m" from Q2\~ in the same directory
	Run Q2.m from MATLAB
	-It will generate graphs for steady state protein production without inducer and also for Phase 1 and Phase 2 as 		described in the question.
Additional
	Explanation and assumptions for the code is given in ChemE 7770_Samavi_Prelim_1.pdf (pg 4-5)
	U1, U2, U3 (ranks) are also attached as Q2\U.txt 
	Time averaged sensitivity arrays are generated as the variables S1,S2 and S3 for Phase 1 and early/late Phase 2.
